It's a C+ at best. That's what Nilay Patel, editor-in-chief of The Verge, had to say about ChatGPT's writing ability a couple of years ago. I was surprised at first because I thought LLMs were great at writing—but then I realized he had spent over a decade writing and editing high-quality articles. It was just a passing comment in a larger conversation about the promise of the AI industry, but I found myself coming back to it again and again. It’s helped me maintain a balanced mindset about AI tools and how I adopt them at work

Software tools, historically, have been extremely good at being reliable. Their deterministic nature has helped set appropriate expectations for the people using them. AI is not that. **Viewing AI as a fast, always available intern, whose output is C+ at best**, helps me set reasonable expectations. Expectations that keep me cautious while not becoming frustrated when it gets things wrong.

I could be an expert in my domain. But there is a lot of day-to-day work where I could use some help. Modern software development (or many modern jobs, for that matter) requires us to understand, interact with and contribute in many adjacent domains. Now, I have an intern who is likely better than me in those domains—who can help me eliminate, or at least better understand, a few dependencies. It's still *C+ at best*, but many times, that's good enough.

I am expected to do A+ work—especially in my core domain. I can't fully delegate it to a C+ intern and call it a day. If the intern ends up saving my time, I ought to use the saved time to make my work much better. Sometimes, the intern doesn't save any time—and that's OK. It's nothing new. Interns often take more time from you than they save.
